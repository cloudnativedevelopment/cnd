## Overview

**Cloud Native Development** (CND) is about moving your entire development workflow to your kubernetes cluster to:

1. Eliminate integration issues by developing the same way code runs in production.
1. Write code as usual, from your favourite IDE.
1. Forget about building, pushing or deploying containers. 

CND helps you achieve this with a mix of kubernetes automation, file synching between your local file system and kubernetes and hot reloading of containers.
