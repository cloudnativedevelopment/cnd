## How does Okteto work?

Okteto swaps your applications pods by a development container. Lets explain this process with a diagram:

At a high level, Okteto works by swapping pods in your application with a development container. In the diagram above, you can see how Okteto replaced the **api** pods by the development container **api-dev**. 

The development container has a different container image (your development image, with all the tools you need pre-installed) but it keeps the rest of the configuration of the original pods (same identity, environment variables, start command, sidecars, etcâ€¦). Although you can override pretty much every configuration of the pod via the Okteto manifest.

Local code changes are automatically synchronized to the development container via [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing). To accomplish this, Okteto launches syncthing both locally and in the development container. Both processes are securely connected via Kubernetes' port forwarding capabilities.
