## How does Okteto work?

Okteto swaps your applications pods by a development environment. Lets explain this process with a diagram:

At a high level, Okteto works by swapping a pod in your application with a development environment. In the diagram above, you can see how Okteto replaced the **api** pod for the development environment **api-dev**. 

The development environment has a different container image (your development image, with all the tools you need pre-installed) but it keeps the rest of the configuration of the original pod (same identity, environment variables, start command, etcâ€¦). Although you can override pretty much every configuration of the pod via the Okteto yaml manifest.

Local code changes are automatically synchronized to the development environment via [syncthing](https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing). To accomplish this, Okteto launches syncthing both locally and in the development environment pod.  Both processes are securely connected via Kubernetes' port forwarding capabilities.
